# decay

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

### Flutter

We use Flutter's beta channel:
```
flutter channel beta && flutter upgrade
```
### Env vars

Create duplicates of [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample) as `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` for the two flavors we have.

### Run

You can use VS Code's Run tab.
